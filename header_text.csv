0,A. Executive Summary,"
Amaris AI is developing a virtual assistant (chatbot) for the purpose of replicating the services and responses expected of a human service staff. The virtual assistant could take the form of a backend engine providing conversational responses based on knowledge bases, backend databases or predefined answers. The chatbot has an application layer, if required, to facilitate the conversation sessions.

Fig 1 System design (overview)"
40,D.2 Document ingestion and chatbot training,"
Fig 2. Document Ingestion architecture
Fig 2 shows the architecture for document processing which includes FAQs, user manuals etc. 
Documents uploaded through the application layer (Chatbot training and evaluation module) will be passed to the model training controller which will orchestrate the model utilisation / re training as required. 
Based on the document type (image / text based) as identified by the document decoder, the controller will either pass it to the image processing cluster or direct to the document comprehension cluster.
The image processing cluster seeks to identify, extract and convert segments of the image-based document into annotated datasets for the document comprehension cluster to digest. Object types include images, tables, text etc.
The document comprehension cluster seeks to first segment the document into meaningful header and content groups for an efficient filtration model. Subsequently, the groups are encoded into semantically meaningful representations, based on the language detected, which will be used as a base for the comprehension model. 
All weights, documents and encoded representations will then be stored into the database layer for application use.
For recurrent learning purposes, the intent classifier will be retrained to be directed at the new document section. The machine comprehension model will be retrained if the answer span has been corrected.
Fig 3. Chatbot Training architecture
Fig 3 shows the architecture for other areas of chatbot training which includes NER, intent classification and action definition. 
Based on the inputs from the application layer, the model training controller will orchestrate the model utilisation / re training as required. 
The pre-trained layer will provide text pre-processing for the generalisation and cleaning of the training questions, context management and language identification. It will be called upon first by the controller.
The NER model will be trained upon admin defined entity sets and location within sentences / questions. NER will be utilised for entity extraction which will be used to populate specific action fields (database query fields etc.)
The intent classification model will be trained upon processed question list through statistical and semantic methods to provide contextually aware models with language understanding. 
Finally, the action trainer will integrate with the NER to populate admin defined queries with the extracted entities. The trainer will also integrate with the middleware integrator to execute the queries.
For recurrent learning purposes, the intent classifier, NER model and Action trainer may be retrained, depending on the correction type and scope."
41,D.3 Chatbot session architecture,"
Fig 4. Chatbot session architecture
Fig 4 shows the architecture for a chatbot session as instantiated by the chatbot channels. 
When a user session start, the chatbot channels will instantiate a session with the input processing controller which will orchestrate the input processing, client authentication (if required) and response / action execution through the middleware integrator.
The input from the chatbot channels will first be pre-processed through the NLP model and the NER model for standardisation and entity extraction. 
The processed input will then be passed to the intent recognition and action execution cluster. Based on the conversation tier, the context manager will record and provide prior tier’s details such as entities recognised, and intent identified for contextual conversations with the user. Should the intent be classified as a document query, the input and the document contents identified will be passed the document intelligence cluster.
The document intelligence cluster will first encode the query and document contents before running through the machine comprehension model for response extraction.
All database queries will be executed through the middleware integrator and all transactions will be recorded by the session controller. Event management (such as unfulfilled sessions being passed to the live agent) will be handled by the session controller as well.
