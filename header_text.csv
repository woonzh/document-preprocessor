"
1,Purpose,"
The purpose of this work instruction is to provide a user operating guide to the Pattern Manager application used by Customer Service Delivery Service Outage Management (SOM) to identify potential outages from related customer fault patterns."
2,Scope,"
This document is a system user guide for Pattern Manager 6.0.
It describes and explains the features, screen elements, field values, and patterning and display rules and provides instructions on login, navigation, support and using the various functions.
This document does not directly cover the business processes used by SOM consultants to monitor, analyse or action related fault patterns as part of outage management. 

For details of these procedures refer to work instructions  Outage Identification & Setup and  Pattern Manager – Identification & Actioning of Related Fault Patterns."
3,Broadband CAN Patterner 2.0,"
Identifies related broadband fault patterns on CAN copper cable elements e.g. Pillar

Faults can appear in more than one Patterner. For example, a fault with both common Switching and CAN elements may appear in both CAN and Switch Patterners (e.g. When it is “fed” by both the same pillar and is in the same AXE Exchange Magazine). In these cases, an active hyperlink will allow the user to toggle between the 2 patterns or view them side by side. Faults with common PGS and CAN elements will also be hyperlinked. This facilitates analysis of the true underlying common network element.

Related fault patterns formed and displayed in Pattern Manager are indications of potential outage only and must be investigated and analysed by SOM Complex Consultants, using a range of other systems and tools, e.g. SULTAN, NPAMS, GDD, CASINO, etc. and/or by consulting with CT’s or other technical workgroups before a final determination and scope of an outage can be confirmed."
4,Switch Patterner 6.0,"
Identifies related fault patterns on Exchange Switches e.g. AXE or S12"
5,PGS Patterner 6.0,"
Identifies related fault patterns on Pair Gain Systems e.g. RIM or RAM 8"
6,CAN Patterner 6.0,"
Identifies related fault patterns on CAN copper cable elements e.g. main cable"
7,Overview of Pattern Manager 6.0,"
Pattern Manager 6.0 is a web based application which interfaces with SIIAM.

Pattern Manager (PM) is used to identify related fault patterns with a common network element which may indicate an outage.

An outage is any significant disruption to the network affecting multiple services and with a single or related technical cause.

PM gathers SIIAM data for customer fault reports which meet certain criteria – e.g. specific FNN types, symptom codes and plant types and which are within a 72 hour reporting window - and then applies patterning rules to identify common network elements e.g. customer faults having the same Pillar or same Pair Gain System. 

Patterned faults are stored until certain display criteria are met and then are displayed in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) screen as colour-differentiated groups along with key information to facilitate pattern analysis by SOM consultants. (Refer Figure 1)

Faults (new and existing) are re-analysed every 10 minutes.

A Check code field allows the user to mark off patterns with the determination made/action taken.

A SOM Administrator option allows SOM managers and complex consultants to adjust fault pattern display thresholds and to make some other basic changes (e.g. to add or remove symptom and/or check-off codes) in response to operational requirements.
There are 4 different fault Patterners within the Pattern Manager application:
"
8,Overview of major upgrade 2016,"
In November 2016 a major upgrade of Pattern Manager occurred to introduce the following enhancements:

Transition TADA Pattern Manager to a shared java-script web-GUI along with NODS
Implement Priority Patterning of rapid forming and large fault patterns
Implement automatic NODS creation from Priority Patterns
Implement manual creation of NODS direct from within Pattern Manager
Improve fault patterning and display by adding additional functions:
Gateway in all Patterners
Exchange in Switch Patterner
Full network address for AXE and System 12 Switches
‘Update All’ capability
Update User Management to align with current business roles and security requirements.

In parallel with the NODS/Pattern Manager Enhancement, the newly developed Mozart CONEN to NODS solution on the PUMA platform developed by Telstra Service Ops (TSO) Network Automations enables NODS to be created automatically from CONEN notifications raised by Service Assurance Ops (SAO) for network incidents (i.e. unplanned outages affecting core network)."

37,Select Exchange,"
When a Region link is clicked, the CAN Patterner Exchange List will open displaying the various exchanges which contain fault patterns and the number of patterned faults in each.
To the right of the Exchange List a version history gives details of the changes introduced in each successive version of Pattern Manager.
The Exchange List allows a user to:"
38,CAN Exchange screen,"
When an Exchange is clicked, the Exchange screen will present, displaying any related fault patterns present in the exchange along with key information to assist with initial analysis.
Exchange List remains visible at left to allow quick selection of the next exchange.
The main section of the screen displays basic details of customer faults reports which meet CAN patterning criteria (see next section 8.4).
The following details are displayed from left to right in the middle section of the screen
HP Hyperlinks – if the fault also appears in a fault pattern in another Patterner (e.g. PGS) the hyperlink letter will be bold and underlined:
P (PGS) – S (Switch) – B (BB CAN)

Faulty FNN (Full National Number)
Date & Time of fault report
Fault Symptom code (e.g. NTN – No Tone)
CAN Network Elements
Main cable/mpair – Cabinet/bpair – Gateway/opair – Pillar/opair – Control Joints/opair
Only the first 2 Control Joints from the exchange end are displayed
If a Network Element column is blank, that type of network element is not present in that FNN’s service
NOTE: to simplify the display and make analysis easier, only CAN network elements are displayed in CAN Patterner. To see Pair Gain Systems or Switch devices present in a service or pattern it is necessary to use the hyperlinks (if active) or consult Shazbot or NPAMS.
‘X’ – Service Type as recorded in NPAMS e.g. XR = ADSL service – SS = PSTN service (see table section 14.6)
NODS ID
If a NODS has been created automatically by Priority Patterner or manually from within CAN Patterner, the NODS ID will display here
NODS manually created in native NODS will NOT display
NODS auto-created by Mozart or other external interfaces will NOT display

User ID of the user who has Checked off the fault pattern
Check List (‘Chk_lst’) indicating determination made/action taken on fault pattern e.g. CVH – Confirmed Volume Hold – NYV – Not Yet Volume Hold (refer table section 14.8) "
39,Form CAN fault pattern,"
A related fault pattern will form in the background in CAN Patterner whenever:
2 or more SIIAM customer trouble reports meet the following criteria:
Symptom code is one of: CBO, CTK, EXO, ICP, NSF, NSY, NTN, NWO, OGP, PLR, SSI, SSS, TSM, UCC, ULI, ULL, VMT, CCO, COS, DTP, DTI, DTG, DTD, DTH, and…
Faults are in the same Exchange Service Area (ESA)	and…
Faults are in the same Pillar	or…
Where there is no pillar, in the same Control Joint (closest to the exchange)	or…
Where there is no Pillar or Control Joint, in the same Gateway
Where there is no Gateway, in the same Cabinet	or…
Where there is no Pillar, Control joint, Gateway or Cabinet, in the same Main Cable	and…
The O, branch or main pair is within 30 pairs of the lowest pair in the pattern
Fault pattern will be retained for 72 hours from fault report date or for the timeframe configured by SOM in the ‘Update Age of Pattern Data’ table of Pattern Manager Admin 2.0
Only the valid Symptom Code and Age of Pattern Data timeframe rules can be changed by SOM. Changes can only be made by a user with NODS-PM Super User Access Level via the Pattern Manager Admin function. All other rules are hard coded into Pattern Manager.
NOTE: ADSL Symptom codes for connectivity issues most indicative of exchange line problems have been added to the normal exchange line symptom code list."
40,Display CAN fault pattern,"
While a basic CAN fault pattern will ALWAYS form in the background of CAN Patterner, fault patterns will only become visible in an Exchange screen in CAN Patterner when the following criteria are met:
The above patterning rules have been met and patterns have formed in the background
The number of patterned faults is equal to or greater than the patterning threshold configured by SOM in the Update Patterning Threshold’ table of Pattern Manager Admin 2.0
For example, when the Threshold Setting is set to ‘5’ a fault pattern will only display when there are 5 patterned faults in the same exchange and the same pillar, etc.
Faults so displayed can be in the one 30 pair grouping or in a combination of 30 pair patterns 

e.g. If the Threshold was set to 5 then the rule would be met if there were:
5 faults in one 30 pair group
E.g.  P5 – pairs 3 + 9 +10 +18 +25
2 faults in one 30 pair group plus 3 faults in another 30 pair group or “2+3”:
E.g.  P5 – pairs 3 + 9 plus 74 + 87 + 91 
2 faults in one 30 pair group plus 2 faults in another plus 2 faults in another or “2+2+2”:
E.g.  P5 – pairs 3 + 9 plus 51 + 56 plus 89+ 97
Each 30 pair grouping is distinguished by a band of different background colour
Only the 2 Control Joints (CJ) closest to the exchange are displayed
CJ faults are only patterned on the CJ closest to the exchange. CJ 2 is display only"
41,DummyFNN cases,"
CAN Patterner will also display any Plant & Equipment cases with a symptom code of UCC (Underground Cable Cut) whenever the exchange in which the fault occurs also has a valid displayed fault pattern
Plant & Equipment cases with a Symptom code of UCC are created whenever a damage is reported to an underground cable.
E.g. a UCC damage case is reported in an exchange but the current threshold for displaying fault patterns (5) has not yet been met – the DummyFNN case does not display. However, when a fault pattern meets the display criteria and appears in the exchange, so too will the UCC DummyFNN case
Damage related P&E cases have an FNN formed from the text ‘DummyFNN’ and the Case number e.g. ‘DummyFNN131234567’. In CAN Patterner this FNN will appear shortened by replacing the ‘DummyFNN’ with an asterisk e.g. ‘*131234567’
The details of DummyFNN faults must be investigated in SIIAM to determine whether or not they are related to the fault pattern in the exchange."
42,Faults with no cable details,"
CAN Patterner will also display any faults which have no cable details whenever the exchange in which the fault occurs also has a valid displayed fault pattern
E.g. a case with no cable details is reported in an exchange but the current threshold for displaying fault patterns (5) has not yet been met – the no cable details case does not display. However, when a fault pattern meets the display criteria and appears in the exchange, so too will case with no cable details
Faults with no cable details may have ANY Symptom code.
Faults with no cable details generally occur for one of 5 main reasons:
A fault has been created for a service which is working over copper network which has now been asset transferred to Nbnco (known as ‘Continuity’ or CSLL services)
A fault has been created for a data line where the cable details have not been available from NPAMS to populate the Cable Details tab
A fault has been created for the exchange or auxiliary line of an ISDN service
A fault has been created to log a fault on multiple services for a business
An error has occurred during case creation
The details of DummyFNN faults must be investigated in SIIAM to determine whether or not they are related to the fault pattern in the exchange."
43,Control Joints,"
Only the first CJ closest to the exchange will be used for patterning
Only the first 2 CJs closest to the exchange will be visible 
Any subsequent CJs in the cable route will be ignored for patterning and will not be visible on the screen"
44,Pair Gain Systems,"
To simplify the display, PGS will not appear in CAN patterner network elements even when present in the service
If the FNN is also in a PGS pattern, the P (PGS) hyperlink will be active
The presence of PGS can also be suspected by the following evidence:
Access Large PGS = absence of main cable (although services fed by ‘secondary’ or ‘out of area’ PGS may have main cables and pairs)
CAN Electronic Small PGS = presence of CJ (although straight lines can also run through CJs)
ADSL DSLAM = ‘x’ service type is XR or XS"
45,Special CAN patterning and display rules,"
In addition to the above basic CAN patterning and display rules there are some special rules:"
46,CAN Fault Patterning Rules,"
In CAN Patterner there are separate rules for:
Forming a pattern of faults
Displaying a pattern of faults
Special CAN Patterning & Display Rules"
47,Analyse CAN Fault Pattern,"
A related fault pattern in CAN Patterner is only an indication of a potential outage. To confirm the presence of an outage to a single network element having caused all the faults in the pattern, further detailed investigation and analysis must be conducted by SOM Complex Consultants using both the information in Pattern Manager itself and in external systems.
The below sequence describes the basic general approach: 
Investigate fault and network detail within the CAN pattern e.g. fault report times, symptom codes and contiguity of affected pairs
Use hyperlinks to compare fault and network detail in other Patterners e.g. which fault pattern gives the clearer and more compelling evidence
Investigate individual customer and fault details of each FNN in pattern, e.g. SIIAM case details, history and notes
Run a SIIAM query to identify any related faults which did not meet patterning display criteria
Investigate customer type and address patterns and pair occupancy of range in CASINO (Clarification of Affected Services in Network Outage) tool or NPAMS
Check cable location and route and relative location of faults using GDD (Graphical Data Display) network maps
Test services in SULTAN particularly when there is an apparent gap in the affected range (“testing within the range”)
Ring CT’s or Team leaders for more information"
48,Create NODS from CAN Patterner,"
If an outage has been confirmed on a CAN network element included in the fault pattern, create a NODS notification directly from within CAN Patterner using the ‘Create NODS’ button.
This provides the quickest response to the outage and ensures that FOH consultants and customers will be advised of the outage at the earliest opportunity.
Follow these basic steps:
Select the affected network element e.g. Main Cable or Pillar ID using the Network Element selection field
Enter the affected pair range in the Pair Selection field e.g. 1-50
Click the ‘Create NODS’ button
After a brief pause the NODS ID that has been created will display in the NODs ID column
The NODS can be opened directly using this link, allowing changes to be made (e.g. adding Parent case and CONEN IDs)

NOTE: Round out to the actual pair range of the affected cable as determined by investigation of CASINO, NPAMS and/or GDD e.g. a pattern in comprising related faults on a common Pillar P5 between 7 and 46 would typically be rounded out to the standard size of a 50 pair cable (pairs 1-50) once further investigation (e.g. in SIIAM and SULTAN) had confirmed that there were no faults beyond pair 50.
Refer also Section 14.5"
49,NOTE: Users with a PM Read-only Access Level can view the Check off code that has been applied by SOM but are unable to add or change Check off codes.,"
For detailed instructions on the above, refer section 14.7
For a table of valid check off codes and their meanings refer to section 14.8

"
50,Check off CAN Fault Pattern,"
Once the pattern has been analysed and a determination made as to the findings and the action to be taken, each fault in the pattern must be ‘checked off’ to indicate this finding/action e.g. CVH = Confirmed Volume Hold or NYV = Not Yet Volume Hold.
Initially, when first appearing, faults in a pattern will display the SIIAM case status of the fault when it first met Pattern Manager criteria e.g. Test-Pending or Field-Open.
There are 3 methods of applying a check-off code:
Apply a common code to all faults in the Exchange using the Update All function
Apply a common code to selected faults in the Exchange using the selection boxes
Apply a single code to each individual fault using the individual drop down lists
To apply a check off action code to each fault in the pattern follow these basic steps:
Choose the most appropriate Check off method from the above e.g. if all faults in the exchange are part of the one outage use Method 1
Apply the correct code
Click the Update or Update All buttons to save the code and update the exchange display and the totals in the Exchange list and Region Dashboard"
51,CAN Patterner Version 6.0,"
CAN Patterner 6.0 forms and displays fault patterns related by a common CAN copper cable network element e.g. main cable, cabinet, gateway, pillar or control joint.
Click the CAN Patterner Version 6.0 link from the Pattern Manager home screen to access CAN Patterner."

Check List (‘Chk_Lst’) indicating determination made/action taken on fault pattern e.g. CVH – Confirmed Volume Hold – NYV – Not Yet Volume Hold (refer table section 14.8) "
62,Form PGS fault pattern,"
A related fault pattern will form in the background in PGS Patterner whenever:
2 or more SIIAM customer trouble reports meet the following criteria:
Symptom code is one of: CBL, CBO, CCO, CEF, COS, CTK, EXO, ICP, NSF, NSY, NTN, NWO, OGP, TSM, UCC, VMT, DTP, DTD, DTG, DTI,	and…
Faults have a PGS type of:
Access Core (CMUX, SSNMUX, RIM, RCM or DCS20) 	and/or…
CAN Electronic (1+4W, 2DPGS, 4DPGS, RAM8 Ph1, RAM8 Ph2, RAM8V90, MLC 6/15, 6/16, 16/96 or SCADS)	and…
Faults are in the same ESA	and…
Faults are in the same PGS Id
When faults contain both Access Core and CAN Electronic PGS the pattern will be formed on the PGS Id with the greatest number of faults
Where there are equal numbers of faults with the same two PGS Id (i.e. Access Core and CAN Electronic), the pattern will be formed on the Access Core PGS
Faults are retained in a pattern for 72 hours from report date.
Fault pattern will be retained for 72 hours from fault report date or for the timeframe configured by SOM in the ‘Update Age of Pattern Data’ table of Pattern Manager Admin 2.0
Only the valid Symptom Code and Age of Pattern Data timeframe rules can be changed by SOM. Changes can only be made by a user with NODS-PM Super User Access Level via the Pattern Manager Admin function. All other rules are hard coded into Pattern Manager.
NOTE: Fault patterns are NOT formed on other PGS types (e.g. DSLAM or CAN Radio)
NOTE: ADSL Symptom codes for connectivity issues most indicative of exchange line problems have been added to the normal exchange line symptom code list."
63,Display PGS fault pattern,"
While a basic PGS fault pattern will ALWAYS form in the background of PGS Patterner, fault patterns will only become visible in an Exchange screen in PGS Patterner when the following criteria are met:
The above patterning rules have been met and patterns have formed in the background
The number of patterned faults is equal to or greater than the patterning threshold configured by SOM in the Update Patterning Threshold’ table of Pattern Manager Admin 2.0 for PGS
For example, when the Threshold Setting is set to ‘4’ a fault pattern will only display when there are 4 patterned faults in the same exchange and the same PGS ID, etc."
64,CMUX DSLAM catastrophic failure,"
Catastrophic failure of a CMUX which is only providing ADSL broadband service can in rare circumstances result in a loss of telephony service along with internet. 
As PGS Patterner does not form or display patterns on faults where the CMUX is only providing ADSL (i.e. via an ADSL* card/port) such an outage may not be immediately obvious as a PSTN outage on that CMUX, although it is highly likely that in the event of an extensive failure the following patterns would be visible:
PGS Patterner – a pattern BOTH PSTN (‘NTN’) and ADSL (‘DT*”) on the CMUX POTS, RIM or other Access PGS which is providing the Exchange Access component of the customers’ services
CAN Patterner – pattern(s) BOTH PSTN (‘NTN’) and ADSL (‘DT*”) on common Pillar, Cabinet or Main Cable
BB CAN Patterner – pattern of ADSL faults on common Pillar, Cabinet or Main Cable displaying the failed CMUX in the right hand DSLAM column
Switch Patterner – pattern of BOTH PSTN (‘NTN’) and ADSL (‘DT*”) faults formed on common Switch Id with Device type ‘LIG’ or ‘xxV’ e.g. ‘30V’
SOM staff should contact SAO to confirm PSTN impact if in doubt."
65,Table CMUX network role and Port/card types,"
PGS Patterner will form a fault pattern on a CMUX whenever the card/port type is POTS, 2B1Q, ADSP or ADSLP i.e. Access Core or combination Access Core/DSL.
PGS Patterner will NOT form fault patterns on a CMUX where the card/port type is ADSL (i.e. functioning as DSLAM in service only) although these faults may be included in otherwise valid patterns in which case the CMUX ADSL component will be “hidden’ in the right hand PGS columns (as with other types of DSLAM) but will be indicated by the presence of an ‘XR’ or ‘XS’ ADSL ‘X’ code. These faults may also appear in other Patterners e.g. BB CAN Patterner
Sometimes 2 different CMUX will be deployed to provide service to a customer FNN – one to provide telephony (‘POTS’) and another to provide Broadband (‘ADSL’) e.g. CMUX E7 (using ‘POTS’ card) and CMUX E2 (using ‘ADSL2’ card)
In these instances PGS Patterner will pattern on the Access Core CMUX and display it in the left hand PGS columns
Sometimes different cards within the same CMUX will be used to provide service to a customer e.g. CMUX E7 (‘POTS’ card) and CMUX E7 (separate ‘ADSL2’ card)
In these instances PGS Patterner will pattern on and display the POTS component (Panel/Slot/Channel of ‘POTS’ card) of the CMUX in the left hand PGS columns"
66,CMUX Network Role,"
CMUX may function in a customer’s service as either Access Core to provide exchange service (i.e. dial tone) in lieu of copper main cable or as DSLAM to provide ADSL internet service or both depending on the type of card or port used.
In PGS Patterner 6.0 CMUX faults pattern and display according to the role the CMUX plays in providing customer service as indicated by the NPAMS Port type (refer Table 4):
Access Core (PSTN or ISDN)
DSLAM (ADSL)
Combination (Access Core and ADSL)
"
67,Slave Unit,"
An exchange based Network Unit (NU) feeding a series of remote Slave Units each with its own remote unit (AU). Each Slave Unit supplies services to a different geographical locality. 
Slave Units appear separately in Pattern Manager with PGS ID like ‘E04003/2, E04003/3, etc.’ 
PGS Patterner 6.0 forms and displays patterns by treating Slave Units as a separate PGS Id:
 4 faults each on a different Slave of the one PGS Id e.g. E7/2, E7/3, E7/5 and E7/7 will NOT form a valid pattern
4 faults on the same slave unit e.g. E7/6, E7/6, E7/6 and E7/6 will form a valid pattern
Outages affecting multiple Slave Units will not appear until the threshold is reached for one of the affected Slave Units. As the threshold is reached for other Slave Units they too will appear – as separate colour-differentiated patterns – providing a clue to the widespread nature of the outage"
68,Master ,"
An exchange based Network Unit (NU) feeding a remote based Access Unit (AU) either in the street or in a multi-storey building. Called a ‘master’ unit in common terminology.
Appear in Pattern Manager with a PGS ID like “E04003”"
69,CMUX Master and Slave types,"
CMUX are complex Pair Gain Systems which can function in a variety of ways and configurations to deliver a combination of telephony (‘POTS’ – Plain Old Telephone Service), broadband (ADSL), ISDN and/or narrowband special services (data lines).
CMUX have 2 main physical configurations:"
70, CMUX patterning & display rules,"
Due the ability of CMUX (Customer Multiplexer) PGS to perform various network roles for a service according to the card and port type installed, PGS patterner uses some additional rules for CMUX patterning and display:"
71,PGS in secondary exchange,"
Sometimes services are delivered by employing an Access PGS in a larger ‘secondary’ exchange to provide exchange access to a smaller sub-exchange. This is most commonly used in rural and remote areas. Typically the Remote Unit (RU) of the PGS will be co-located with exchange MDF in the sub-exchange building where the local main pairs will connect to the PGS C pairs. The RU then links back to the larger secondary exchange via its fibre link to the Exchange Unit (EU) of the PGS.
This arrangement will result in the customer and their copper cable pairs (e.g. main cable and pillar) belonging to one exchange (e.g. LOST Lost River) and the Access PGS ‘feeding’ their service being in another exchange (e.g. GLBN Goulburn)
Pattern Manager will display this like:
In PGS Patterner:
Pattern will form in exchange to which the customer and main cable belongs
PGS will display in this pattern without any indication of belonging to another exchange
The usual clue though is the presence of BOTH Access PGS AND Main Cable (normally an Access PGS REPLACES main cable)

In CAN Patterner:
Pattern will form in exchange to which the customer and main cable belongs
A clue may be the presence of BOTH a Main Cable AND an active hyperlink to PGS Patterner (providing a pattern has formed in PGS Patterner as well)
SOM Complex Consultants will need to be alert to these clues and to confirm the presence of a ‘secondary exchange’ PGS by checking cable details in Shazbot.
A native NODS will need to be loaded on BOTH the PGS ‘secondary’ exchange and the customer exchange.
Priority Patterner (and Mozart CONEN to NODS automation) will automatically load NODS in this way for these scenarios."
72,Limitation on number of PGS displayed,"
PGS Patterner 6.0 screen has only 2 sets of PGS display columns – one on the left coded to display Access Core PGS and another on the right to display CAN Electronic PGS. 
This means that (comparatively rare) instances of where there are 2 Access Core PGS + 1 Small PGS or where there is one Access PGS and 2 Small PGS, one of the PGS will NOT be displayed. In these cases PGS Patterner will pattern and display the PGS closest to the exchange."
73,Display of PGS types,"
Only Access Core or CAN Electronic PGS types are displayed in PGS Patterner. 
If a FNN in a PGS pattern contains another type of PGS e.g. FTTP, DSLAM or CAN Radio these PGS will not be displayed.
The presence of other types of PGS can be only identified by the following clues:
The right hand PGS column is blank AND…
An ADSL ‘X’ code such as ‘XR’ or ‘XS’ will indicate the presence of a DSLAM
A remote or island exchange (e.g. THUT Thursday Island) may include a CAN Radio PGS"
74,Special PGS patterning and display rules,"
In addition to the above basic PGS patterning and display rules there are some special rules:"
75,PGS Fault Patterning Rules,"
In PGS Patterner there are separate rules for:
Forming a pattern of faults
Displaying a pattern of faults
Special PGS Rules"
76,Analyse PGS Fault Pattern,"
A related fault pattern in PGS Patterner is only an indication of a potential outage. To confirm the presence of an outage to a single network element having caused all the faults in the pattern, further detailed investigation and analysis must be conducted by SOM Complex Consultants using both the information in Pattern Manager itself and in external systems.
The below sequence describes the basic general approach: 
Check CONEN for an Network Incident on the affected Access Large PGS
Check ‘! SOM Production’ mailbox for an email advice of Small PGS outage
Investigate fault and network detail within the PGS pattern e.g. fault report times, symptom codes and common Panel and Slot
Use hyperlinks to compare fault and network detail in other Patterners e.g. which fault pattern gives the clearer and more compelling evidence
Investigate individual customer and fault details of each FNN in pattern, e.g. SIIAM case details, history and notes
Run a SIIAM query to identify any related faults which did not meet patterning display criteria
Investigate customer type and address patterns in CASINO (Clarification of Affected Services in Network Outage) tool
Check relative location of faults using GDD (Graphical Data Display) network maps
Ring CT’s or GOC for more information"
77,Create NODS from PGS Patterner,"
If an outage has been confirmed on a PGS network element included in the fault pattern, create a NODS notification directly from within PGS Patterner using the ‘Create NODS’ button.
This provides the quickest response to the outage and ensures that FOH consultants and customers will be advised of the outage at the earliest opportunity.
Follow these basic steps:
Select the affected network element e.g. large or Small PGS ID using the Network Element selection field
Enter the affected Panel and or Panel and Slot range in the Panel & Slot Selection fields e.g. Panel 3 Slots 1-3
Click the ‘Create NODS’ button
After a brief pause the NODS ID that has been created will display in the NODs ID column
The NODS can be opened directly using this link, allowing changes to be made (e.g. adding Parent case and CONEN IDs)

Refer also Section: 14.5"
78,NOTE: Users with a PM Read-only Access Level can view the Check off code that has been applied by SOM but are unable to add or change Check off codes.,"
For detailed instructions on the above, refer section 14.7
For a table of valid check off codes and their meanings refer to section 14.8

"
79,Check off PGS Fault Pattern,"
Once the pattern has been analysed and a determination made as to the findings and the action to be taken, each fault in the pattern must be ‘checked off’ to indicate this finding/action e.g. CVH = Confirmed Volume Hold or NYV = Not Yet Volume Hold.
Initially, when first appearing, faults in a pattern will display the SIIAM case status of the fault when it first met Pattern Manager criteria e.g. Test-Pending or Field-Open.
There are 3 methods of applying a check-off code:
Apply a common code to all faults in the Exchange using the Update All function
Apply a common code to selected faults in the Exchange using the selection boxes
Apply a single code to each individual fault using the individual drop down lists
To apply a check off action code to each fault in the pattern follow these basic steps:

Choose the most appropriate Check off method from the above e.g. if all faults in the exchange are part of the one outage use Method 1
Apply the correct code
Click the Update or Update All buttons to save the code and update the exchange display and the totals in the Exchange list and Region Dashboard"

121,Analyse BB CAN Fault Pattern,"
A related fault pattern in BB CAN Patterner is only an indication of a potential outage. To confirm the presence of an outage to a single network element having caused all the faults in the pattern, further detailed investigation and analysis must be conducted by SOM Complex Consultants using both the information in Pattern Manager itself and in external systems.
A primary method of determining if the BB CAN pattern is more likely to indicate a CAN issue versus a DSLAM issue is to check the right hand PGS column:
Fault pattern with common DSLAM is more likely to be due to a broadband issue

Fault pattern with multiple DSLAMs may indicate a CAN issue – investigate further
Check CONEN for a network Incident on the affected DSLAM
Check WFC Outage board for a known ADSL outage on the affected DSLAM
Investigate fault and network detail within the BB CAN pattern e.g. fault report times, symptom codes and contiguity of affected pairs and whether services are provided over common DSLAM or not.
Use hyperlinks to compare fault and network detail in other Patterners e.g. which fault pattern gives the clearer and more compelling evidence
Investigate individual customer and fault details of each FNN in pattern, e.g. SIIAM case details, history and notes
Run a SIIAM query to identify any related faults which did not meet patterning display criteria
Investigate customer type and address patterns and pair occupancy of range in CASINO (Clarification of Affected Services in Network Outage) tool or NPAMS
Check cable location and route and relative location of faults using GDD (Graphical Data Display) network maps
Test services in SULTAN or OATS particularly when there is an apparent gap in the affected range (“testing within the range”)
Ring CT’s or WFC for more information"
122,Create NODS,"
There is no functionality to enable NODS to be created directly in BB CAN Patterner.
If the evidence points strongly towards a CAN issue affecting Broadband services, this should be brought to the attention of Assurance Ops Workflow Coordinators (WFC) so that further investigation can be undertaken.
If it was deemed necessary to create a NODS for a BB CAN pattern, this will need to be done in native NODS."
123,BVH Check off code,"
There is a specific Check Off code to indicate a fault pattern which has been identified by SOM as belonging to an ADSL Outage already set up by WFC:
BVH (Broadband Volume Hold)
This can be identified by checking the WFC Outage Board on the following URL:
The WFC Outage board contains both Active and Ceased outage lists. SOM need to check both. BVH will be applied to either an Active of Ceased WFC outage as these outages also use a Callbacks process to verify restoration.
For detailed instructions on Checking off patterns, refer section 14.7
For a table of valid check off codes and their meanings refer to section 14.8

"
124,Check off BB CAN Fault Pattern,"
Once the pattern has been analysed and a determination made as to the findings and the action to be taken, each fault in the pattern must be ‘checked off’ to indicate this finding/action e.g. CVH = Confirmed Volume Hold or NYV = Not Yet Volume Hold.
Initially, when first appearing, faults in a pattern will display the SIIAM case status of the fault when it first met Pattern Manager criteria e.g. Test-Pending or Field-Open.
There are 3 methods of applying a check-off code:
Apply a common code to all faults in the Exchange using the Update All function
Apply a common code to selected faults in the Exchange using the selection boxes
Apply a single code to each individual fault using the individual drop down lists
To apply a check off action code to each fault in the pattern follow these basic steps:

Choose the most appropriate Check off method from the above e.g. if all faults in the exchange are part of the one outage use Method 1
Apply the correct code
Click the Update or Update All buttons to save the code and update the exchange display and the totals in the Exchange list and Region Dashboard"
125,Broadband Patterner Version 2.0,"

143,Priority Patterning Rules - Unchecked,"
An Unchecked Priority Pattern (PP) will be formed in any of the 4 Patterners when the current Priority Patterning criteria as configured in Pattern Manager Admin are met.
Very simple rules apply to the patterning rules for Unchecked PPs:
The number of unchecked patterned faults in an exchange has met or exceeded the Unchecked Reports Threshold set by SOM in Pattern Manager Admin e.g. 20

The PP alert will display in the Priority Outage dashboard on the whole exchange and may relate to a number of network elements e.g. more than one PGS ID

An Auto-NODS will never be created"
144,Patterner Hierarchy rule,"
The Priority Patterner hierarchy rule determines in which Patterner and on which network element the PP (and auto-NODS) is created:
If a fault pattern in any of the 4 Patterners meets PP criteria and is NOT in any other patterner, form the PP on that Patterner and NE
E.g. a pattern of faults on a Switch meets PP criteria – a PP is formed on the Switch and displayed in Priority Outage Dashboard
If a fault pattern in either Switch and/or BB CAN meets PP criteria but is also in either CAN and/or PGS patterners, form the PP on either CAN or PGS Patterner according to the next 2 rules
E.g. a pattern of faults on a Switch meets PP criteria but is also on a main cable in CAN patterner – a PP is formed on the main cable in CAN patterner in Priority Outage Dashboard along with a S entry in the hyperlink column
If a fault pattern in both PGS and CAN Patterners meets PP criteria, form the PP on the one with the greater number of faults in it.
E.g. a pattern of faults on a Pillar in CAN Patterner meets PP criteria but is also on a Small PGS in PGS Patterner. There are more faults in the CAN pattern– a PP is formed on the Pillar in CAN Patterner and displayed in Priority Outage Dashboard along with a P entry in the hyperlink column
If a fault pattern in both PGS and CAN Patterners meets PP criteria, and the number of faults in each is equal, form the PP on the PGS Patterner and element
E.g. a pattern of faults on a Cabinet in CAN Patterner meets PP criteria but is also on a RIM in PGS Patterner. There are an equal number of faults in each – a PP is formed on the RIM in PGS Patterner in Priority Outage Dashboard along with a C entry in the hyperlink column"
145,PGS Patterner,"
The following rules are used by Pattern Manager to determine the Network Element and range on which to form a Fast PGS Priority pattern and Auto-NODS
If, according to Patterner Hierarchy rules, the PP will be formed on the PGS pattern…
Priority Pattern will form on the PGS ID e.g. TBNE RIM E9801
If PGS Type is RIM or CMUX and all faults are on same Panel AND Slot, create PP just on that on Panel and Slot of the PGS ID e.g. TBNE RIM E9801 Panel 3 Slot 4
If PGS Type is RIM or CMUX and all faults are on same Panel but different Slots, create PP just on that on the Panel of the PGS ID e.g. TBNE RIM E9801 Panel 3
If PGS Type is RIM or CMUX and faults are on different Panels, create PP on whole PGS ID e.g. TBNE RIM E9801
If PGS Type is RCM, DC20 or SSNMUX create PP on whole PGS ID e.g. STHE DCS20 E20
If PGS Type is CAN Electronic Small PGS e.g. 6/16 or RAM 8 create PP on whole PGS ID e.g. CHLT RAM8 Ph1 E7
Display PP alert details in the Priority Outage dashboard according to whichever of the above rules applies
Create an Auto-NODS according to whichever of the above rules applies"
146,Switch Patterner,"
The following rules are used by Pattern Manager to determine the Network Element on which to form a Fast Switch Priority pattern
If, according to Patterner Hierarchy rule, the PP will be formed on the Switch pattern…
Priority Pattern will form on the alpha character component of the Switch ID which meets the PP Trigger criteria e.g. VPNS
E.g. If the combined total of faults across Switch Ids VPNS01, VPNS02 and VPNS03 meets the criteria for PP, a single PP will be created across faults in all 3 Switch IDs and display in Priority Outage Dashboard as a single PP alert on AXE VPNS SWITCH
Switch magazines and LI/EN ranges will always be ignored when Switch Priority patterns are being created
Display PP alert details in the Priority Outage dashboard according to the above rules
NOTE: An Auto-NODS is never created for a Switch Priority Pattern
"
147,NOTE: An Auto-NODS is never created for a BB CAN Priority Pattern,"

"
148,BB CAN Patterner,"
The following rules are used by Pattern Manager to determine the Network Element on which to form a Fast BB CAN Priority pattern
If, according to Patterner Hierarchy the PP will be formed on the BB CAN pattern…
Priority Pattern will form on the CAN Network Element closest to the exchange according to the same criteria as for CAN Patterner 6.0 above
Display PP alert details in the Priority Outage dashboard according to the above rules"
149,Pillar or Control Joint,"
the start pair of the Auto-NODS range will be rounded down to the next even ‘10 +1’ below the lowest displayed value, including 0. 
E.g. if the lowest pair in the pattern was 21 the start pair of the NODS range will be Pair 21
if the lowest pair in the pattern was 245 the start pair of the NODS range will be Pair 240 
the end pair of the Auto-NODS range will be rounded up to the nearest ‘10’
E.g. if the highest pair in the pattern was 21 the end pair of the NODS range will be Pair 30
if the highest pair in the pattern was 383 the end pair of the NODS range will be Pair 380 "

if the lowest pair in the pattern was 245 the start pair of the NODS range will be Pair 201 
the end pair of the Auto-NODS range will be rounded up to the nearest ‘100’
E.g. if the highest pair in the pattern was 21 the end pair of the NODS range will be Pair 50
if the highest pair in the pattern was 783 the end pair of the NODS range will be Pair 800 "
151,Main Cable ,"
the start pair of the Auto-NODS range will be rounded down to the next even ‘100 +1’ below the lowest displayed value, including 0. 
E.g. if the lowest pair in the pattern was 71 the start pair of the NODS range will be Pair 1
if the lowest pair in the pattern was 245 the start pair of the NODS range will be Pair 201 
the end pair of the Auto-NODS range will be rounded up to the nearest ‘100’
E.g. if the highest pair in the pattern was 71 the end pair of the NODS range will be Pair 1500
if the highest pair in the pattern was 1483 the end pair of the NODS range will be Pair 201"
152,"Rule #3 next, selecting the first CAN NE above which meets Rule #1, apply Pair Range Contiguity Rule #2, as follows:","
If Main Cable, does the main pair range include a break in contiguity of > 200 pairs
If yes, then does the Cabinet B Pair range (if present) include a break in contiguity of > 100 pairs
If yes, the does the Gateway O Pair range (if present) include a break in contiguity of > 50 pairs
If yes, the does the Pillar O Pair range (if present) include a break in contiguity of > 50 pairs
If yes, the does the CJ O Pair range (if present) include a break in contiguity of > 30 pairs

If NO network element can meet either Rules #1 and #2 or #1 and #3, Pattern Manager will NOT create an Auto-NODS but will display a Priority Pattern alert on the Dashboard
If Rules #1 and #3 can be met,  the first CAN network element and pair range which meets Rules #1 and #3 will be selected by Pattern Manager on which to create the CAN Priority Pattern and Auto-NODS
However, before an CAN Auto-NODS can be created, Pattern Manager must consult the following rule to determine the start and end pairs of the pair range to be used:
Rule #4 Rounding out the CAN pair ranges"
153,"Rule #2 next, selecting the first CAN NE above which meets Rule #1, apply Pair Range Contiguity Rule #2, as follows:","

If yes, the does the CJ O Pair range (if present) include a break in contiguity of > 30 pairs
The first CAN network element and pair range which meets Rules #1 and #2 will be selected by Pattern Manager on which to create the CAN Priority Pattern and Auto-NODS
If NO CAN network element meets BOTH Rule #1 and #2 but can meet Rule #1 then Pattern manager will use Rule #3 below
"
154,CAN PP Rule #1 First decide on the Network Element on which all the faults are:,"
are all services on one Main Cable
If no, are all services on one Cabinet
If no, are all services on one Gateway
If no, are all services on one Pillar
If no, are all services on one Control Joint
"
155,CAN Patterner,"
The following rules are used by Pattern Manager to determine the Network Element and range on which to form a Fast CAN Priority pattern and Auto-NODS.
Due to the number of possible Network Elements and valid cable Pair ranges involved in CAN fault patterns, the rules which Pattern Manager uses to determine on which Network Element and pair range to set up a CAN Priority Pattern and Auto-NODS are quite complex
If, according to Patterner Hierarchy rules, the PP will be formed on the CAN pattern…
Priority Pattern will form on the CAN Network Element in order of the closest to the exchange which meets CAN rules #1, #2 and #3:"
156,Network Element rules,"
As well as determining which Patterner a Priority Pattern must be formed in, Patten Manager also has to determine on which of the Network Elements present in the faults in the pattern it should create the PP (and the Auto-NODS).
Pattern Manager determines the network element on which to set up a PP by the following rules.
There are different rules for each Patterner:"
157,Priority Patterning Rules - Fast,"
More complex rules apply to the patterning and display of Fast PPs:
The number of patterned faults has met or exceeded the threshold number set by SOM in Priority Manager Admin for a particular timeframe threshold in a region e.g. a pattern of 6 faults has been reported within a timeframe of 5 hours for NSWN region which meets the threshold set by SOM of 6 faults in 5 hours for that region.

In addition to this basic trigger rule, additional rules apply as to:

Which Patterner the PP will be formed in if FNNs exist in more than one Patterner
E.g. a Fast pattern of FNNs in PGS Patterner is also present in CAN
Which Network Element the PP will be formed on
E.g. will a Fast CAN pattern be formed on main cable or Pillar
Which pair range (if any) the PP will be formed on
E.g. will the Fast pattern be formed on the whole PGS or just a C pair range
Whether a NODS will be auto-created for the Fast pattern
See the following sub-sections for details of these rules."
158,Priority Pattern Auto NODS,"
As well as triggering a Priority Pattern alert on the Priority Outage dashboard, Pattern Manager will also attempt to automatically create a NODS on the Exchange, network element and pair range on which the Priority Pattern was formed.
Priority Patterner auto-NODS will only be created on:
CAN Priority Patterns
PGS Priority patterns
Pattern Manager will use the same logic for creating the CAN or PGS Auto-NODS as it uses to create the Priority pattern itself. Refer previous sections 12.2 and 12.3.
E.g. a Priority Pattern has been triggered by Fast criteria and has been created according to the Patterning rules in sections 12.2 and 12.3 on PTMA PGS RIM E2013 Panel 4. An Auto NODS will also be created on PTMA PGS RIM E2013 Panel 4.
If a PGS on which a Priority pattern and an Auto-NODS is being created is one belonging to a secondary exchange which is feeding services in a smaller sub-exchange, Pattern Manager will create the Auto-NODS on the secondary PGS exchange but also add the customer sub-exchange. Refer section 9.4.4.
When Pattern Manager has been able to create an Auto-NODS for a priority pattern, the following will occur:
The ‘Auto-NODS’ column in Priority Outage Dashboard will have a ‘Yes’ entry
The Auto-NODS ID will be added to the ‘NODS_ID’ column of all FNNs in the relevant Patterner
If, despite using the rules in sections 12.1 and 12.3, Pattern Manager has not been able to determine the correct Network Element and range, it will create the PP and display on the Priority Outage Dashboard but will NOT create an Auto-NODS. The ‘auto-NODS’ column on the dashboard will display ‘No’
Auto-NODS are NEVER created for Switch or BB CAN Priority Patterns.
Auto-NODS created by Pattern Manager will have the identical attributes to one created in native NODS by a SOM user with the following exceptions:
An Expected Restoration and ETR will ALWAYS be derived from the SOM Outage ETR matrix table
There will be NO Outage Parent case or CONEN entered in the Outage Description text
Source System will be Pattern Manager
Created User will be Auto-CAN or Auto-PGS
Refer also work Instruction  NODS for Service Outage Management"
159,Investigate Priority Pattern,"
When a new Priority pattern appears in the Priority Outage Dashboard it will need to be investigated by a SOM Complex Consultant.
Investigation of a Priority pattern has 3 objectives:
Validate the Priority Patterning
Update the Auto-NODS (if one was created)
Perform any other required Outage Set-up actions or delegate to other SOM staff
SOM Complex Consultants will follow this basic routine to manage Priority Outage Dashboard:
Monitor Priority Outage Dashboard frequently and regularly thought the day
Action ‘New’ PP alerts as they appear
Select ‘In Progress’ in the Action drop down list
Review the key details of the PP in the Dashboard to quickly get a picture of size, risk and urgency:
What is the Trigger?
How many faults in the outage?
Has an Auto NODS been created
Where is the outage?
What Network Element and range has the PP formed on?
Click the Exchange link to open the Exchange or Node in which the Priority Pattern has formed:
PP will be Checked off ‘AVH’
NODS ID will be present if NODS auto-created
Analyse the Pattern as per BAU Pattern Manager related fault pattern analysis procedures
Determine the following:
Is there a valid outage?
Has Pattern Manager correctly identified the affected network element and range? 
Is the Auto-NODS correctly created?
What needs to be done to set up the outage or perform other response (e.g. link faults)?
Carry out required actions or delegate to other SOM staff or Partners:
Place on Watch in dashboard and patterner(s) if more evidence required or…
Update auto-NODS or…
Create manual NODS from within Patterner 
Set up outage Parent, Query SIIAM, create CNO Log, etc. or…
Email SOM Simplex or Partners to complete the Outage setup or…
Cease auto-NODS and update Patterner Check off code if an alternative response is required e.g. Linking faults
Action the PP alert in the Dashboard according to the findings, as per section 12.5 below
Repeat the above process for the next ‘New’ PP alert"
160,Action Priority Pattern,"
When a new Priority Pattern alert first appears in the Priority Outage Dashboard the Action field will display ‘New’ to alert SOM Complex consultants to the need to investigate it.
When the SOM Complex Consultant commences their investigation they will change the Action code to ‘In progress’ and click the ‘Update’ button. This will update the User field with their User ID.
After completing required investigations and actions, the SOM Complex consultant will change the Action code to one of two outcome Actions (and click Update button):

‘Watch’ – Priority pattern has been investigated but findings are inconclusive - awaiting further evidence

‘Complete’ – Priority pattern has been investigated and validated All required actions have been completed or delegated to other staff to complete e.g. update Auto-NODS, Set up Outage, etc. 

When ‘Complete’ action is selected & updated the record will clear from the Priority Outage Dashboard but the actual related fault pattern in the relevant patterner will remain
 

"
161,Priority Outage Dashboard,"
Priority Outage Dashboard displays key details of fault patterns in any of the 4 Patterners which have met the criteria for a fast forming or large unchecked Priority Pattern (PP) alert.
Priority Patterns (PP) are those which pose the greatest risk to customer service and business operations.
The Priority Patterning functionality is designed to assist SOM in periods of peak fault volumes and/or natural disaster when the capability of SOM and other workgroups to respond to the very high fault volumes can be severely tested. 
There are 2 triggers for the forming and display of a Priority Pattern alert in the Dashboard:"
162,Audit Trail Report,"
Allows SOM Manager to keep track of changes in order to ensure that 
Required changes have been made
Due process and governance has been followed
NOTE: Changes made in SOM Admin 2.0 will only take effect at the next system update. Pattern Manager updates (refreshes) approximately every 10 - 15 minutes. Refer to Section 8.3 Patterner System Refresh Rates Table 9 for details on how to calculate when the changes will take effect."
163,Auto Outage Exchange,"
Allows SOM to exclude exchanges from having NODS auto-created. This is most commonly done for exchanges which have been asset transferred to Nbnco"
164,Update Exchange,"
Allows SOM to add new or delete obsolete exchanges or to move exchanges between Regions (e.g. to align with Regional restructures)"
165,Update PGS Types,"
Allows SOM to include new PGS types into Pattern Manager or to delete obsolete types withdrawn from service"
166,Update Symptom Code,"
Allows SOM to modify the types of faults considered as candidates for patterning."
167,Update Checklist Code,"
Allows SOM to add new check-off codes or delete obsolete ones"
168,Update Age of Patterning data,"
Allows SOM to change the timeframe in which faults will remain in Pattern Manager"
169,Update Patterner Thresholds,"
Allows changes to be made to the minimum number of patterned faults which will be displayed in a pattern for each Patterner and Region.
Allows SOM to respond quickly to changes in workload, staffing and other operational requirements in order to maintain the most efficient, effective outage identification"
170,Update Priority Thresholds,"
Allows SOM to change the thresholds at which a fault pattern will be deemed a Priority Pattern
There are 2 Priority Patterning thresholds:
Fast Forming
Large Unchecked"
171,Guidelines for Pattern Manager Admin changes,"
Changes to Pattern Manager Admin settings can be made in order to implement:
General, long-term system, process and operational performance improvements as a result of 
continuous improvement, new initiatives, troubleshooting, feedback, etc. or 
changes to systems, process or business objectives
Short Term, local changes to manage a local, short duration issue e.g.
Peak workload or natural disaster
To ensure that changes made to pattern Manager have the desired positive outcomes, the following guidelines should be followed: 
Propose changes on the basis of clear thinking and evidence
Test changes in a low risk way, e.g. by introducing to one region
Advise other users of the change and the reason
Advise other users of any changes to their ways of working as a result of the change
Review results of the change
Document adopted changes
Long term general changes should be documented by updating this work instruction 017921w14 Pattern Manager 6.0
Short Term changes which are likely to be adopted as a Mode of Operations may need to be documented in other work instructions such as 017921w01 SOM Natural Disasters as well this work instruction."

174,Update Priority Thresholds,"
The Update Priority Threshold option allows SOM Super Users to reconfigure the triggers for forming Priority Patterns:
Reset number of faults and required timeframe to form a ‘Fast Forming’ priority pattern
Reset number of unchecked faults required to form an ‘Unchecked’ priority pattern
The ‘Current Priority Outage Threshold values’ table displays the current thresholds for each Priority pattern type and each region."
175,Update Patterner Thresholds,"
The Update Patterner Threshold option allows SOM Super Users to reset the number of faults in a pattern at which a Pattern Manager will display a related fault pattern.
Different threshold can be applied for different Patterners and for different regions in Patterners
E.g. If all regions in CAN Patterner are set to a threshold of ‘5’, patterns will not be presented until there are at least 5 faults in the same exchange and same pillar which are in 30 pair groupings.
If Brisbane and QLDC are then reset to 3, fault patterns will appear earlier in those particular regions, when there are only 3 faults in a pattern.
The fault display threshold settings for each Patterner/Region are also known as the Mode of Operation (‘MO’). The Patterner Threshold applied will appear.
To re-configure the Patterner Thresholds follow these steps:
On Administration Page select the ‘Update Patterner Thresholds’ option
In the ‘Modify Thresholds’ window enter the required values:
New Threshold number
Required Region
Required Patterner
Click ‘Update’ button
To make multiple selections, repeat steps ‘6’ and ‘7’
Return to selected Patterner Region dashboard – ‘MO’ (Mode of Operations) column will now display new updated threshold in blue
Change to fault threshold will take place at next refresh - note time on the Exchange Selection list that the system was last refreshed and add 10 minutes to calculate when change will occur.

Advise other users of change and reason"
179,Update PGS Type,"
The Update PGS types option allows SOM Super Users to add new or delete existing Pair Gain System (PGS) types.
Changes to PGS type would normally only be made when:
New PGS Types are introduced into service
Older existing PGS types are withdrawn from service
Pattern Manager only recognises PGS Types which are entered in the precise format used by SIIAM – the system from Pattern Manager collects its data.
Each PGS Type must be allocated a ‘PGS Class’ i.e. network role. There are 3 PGS Network roles recognised by pattern Manager:
Access Core (large PGS e.g. CMUX, RIM, etc.)
CAN electronic (small PGS e.g. RAM 8, SCADS, etc.)
ADSL DSLAM (e.g. AM35, ISAM, etc.)
To re-configure the PGS Type List follow these steps:
On Administration Page, select the ‘Update PGS Types’ option
In the ‘Modify PGS Types’ window enter the required ‘PGS Type’ to be added or deleted:

180,Update Exchange,"
Clicking the Update Exchange option allows SOM Super Users to add new or delete existing Exchanges or to move an existing exchange from one Pattern Manager Region to another (e.g. from country to metro).
Changes to Exchange will be rare and would normally only be made when:
New exchange has been commissioned
Old exchange has been decommissioned
A Regional restructure has caused an exchange previously in a country area to now be metro (or vice versa)
To re-configure the Exchange List follow these steps:
On Administration Page, select the ‘Update Exchange’ option
In the ‘Modify Exchange’ window enter the required ‘Exchange code’ to be added or deleted:
In the ‘Region from’ field enter the Region from which the exchange  is to be removed
In the ‘Region to’ field enter the Region to which the exchange  is to be moved
Click ‘Add’ button to add a new exchange
Click ‘Delete’ button to delete an existing exchange
Click ‘Move’ button to move an existing exchange

"
183,Audit Trail Report,"
Clicking the ‘Audit Trail Report’ option allows users with a SOM Administrator access profile to produce a report listing all SOM Administrator changes made, when and by whom for the specified period.
This report is normally accessed by the SOM Team Manager to:
Ensure due governance over Pattern Manager changes
Maintain the integrity of Pattern Manager patterning effectiveness
Investigate issues, complaints or Post Incident Reviews (PIR)"
184,Pattern Manager Admin Messages,"
When an Update to one of the Pattern Manager Admin settings has been successfully completed, a success message will display.
Select ‘Continue’ to return to Administration Page
If invalid information is entered or required information is not entered on any of the Pattern Manager Admin options, a pop-up error message will display similar to below
Click ‘OK’ to return to the Administration Page and enter correct/missing information.
 
 
"
185,Pattern Manager Admin Version 2.0,"
Pattern Manager Admin Version 2.0 allows SOM staff to configure the way Pattern Manager forms and displays fault patterns.
Only SOM staff with SOM NODS-PM Super User access level are able to see and access the Pattern Manager Admin Version 2.0 link from the Pattern Manager Home screen.
To access Pattern Manager Admin to make changes follow these steps:
On the Patterner Manager Home screen, select the Pattern Manager Admin Version 2.0 option
Administration Page listing the various available Threshold and Value Configuration options will display
Select the required ‘Update’ option
The following functions can be configured from Pattern Manager Admin Version 2.0 option:"
186,Region Fault Pattern plain text view,"
Click on the ‘printable’ hyperlink above the Region List
A new tab will open displaying ALL exchange fault patterns in the region in plain text
The individual patterns in each exchange will be denoted by separate Pattern Ids"
187,Exchange plain text,"
Click on the ‘Scroll’ icon at the left of the blue banner
A new tab will open displaying the exchange fault pattern in plain text
The individual patterns will be denoted by separate Pattern Ids"
188,Plain Text View,"
Each Exchange and Region can be viewed in plain text view for printing, emailing etc. One advantage of the plain view is that each separate pattern is identified by a unique ID.
There are 2 plain views available:
Exchange plain text view
Region plain text view"
189,Hyperlinks to Other Patterners,"
The ‘HP’ columns at the extreme left of the Exchange Pattern screen contain hyperlinks to other Patterners whenever an FNN in one Patterner also appears in another e.g. when a fault which has patterned on a common Pillar in CAN Patterner may also appears in PGS Patterner because it has patterned on a common RIM PGS. 
Hyperlink function allows cross-referencing between Patterners to discover the true underlying common network element.
Hyperlink function is used because it is not practical to pattern on and display all network elements that might provide a service on the one screen.
Each Patterner has been allocated a ‘HP’ hyperlink code letter:
C	CAN Patterner
P	PGS Patterner
S	Switch Patterner
B	Broadband CAN Patterner
When a FNN also appears in another Patterner, that code letter will be “active” – i.e. blue underlined text e.g. P
If a code letter against a particular FNN appears in plain black text and not underlined then the FNN does not appear in that Patterner.
When an active hyperlink is clicked the following will occur:
The other Patterner will open - in a new tab - displaying its Exchange Fault Pattern screen with the selected FNN highlighted in blue text
The windows can then be arranged to best view and compare the pattern information
Clicking the ‘X’ in the new tab will close it and return the user to the original Patterner."
190,Table of PSTN Symptom Codes,"
The following table lists standard SIIAM Symptom (Report) codes selected by FOH consultants to represent the problem being experienced by the customer with their PSTN service and which appear in P{pattern manager fault pattern displays:"
191,Table of ADSL Symptom Codes,"
The following table lists the 3 character code conversion from the standard SIIAM 4 character Symptom (Report) codes selected by FOH consultants to represent the problem being experienced by the customer with their ADSL service and which appear in Pattern manager fault pattern displays:"
192,Create NODS from Patterner,"
The Create NODS functionality allows SOM consultants to immediately create a NODS outage notification (which will appear in SIIAM) directly from within the Patterner Exchange screen as soon as an outage has been analysed and confirmed.
This reduces the amount of time and ‘swivel-chairing’ necessary to set-up outages and to notify FOH and customers.
The Create NODS functionality is available in the following Patterners:
CAN Patterner
PGS Patterner
Switch Patterner
Follow these steps to Create a NODS using the PM Create NODS function
From the information in Pattern Manager and external systems (e.g. CASINO, GDD, etc.) confirm the outage and determine the correct network element and pair range

E.g. network element Pillar P1 and O pair range 81-100 have been determined as the correct scope

Using the drop down boxes select:

The CAN network element  - P1
Enter the pair range 81-100

Click Create NODS button

A NODS will be created ‘semi-automatically’
NODS ID will appear in the NODS column
User can click the NODS ID link to view and update the NODS
The NODS will be created by Pattern Manager with the standard values, ETR and Outage Description as used by SOM to create manual NODS
A CVH check-off code will be automatically applied
Some information, e.g. Parent case and CONEN ID and instructions to offer interims will have to be manually added by using the NODs Update button
NODS created this way will have a Source System of ‘Pattern Manager’ and a Created User of the name of the consultant who used the function

"
193,Service Types,"
The following table lists the various NPAMS Service Type codes which indicate the basic service type of each FNN e.g. whether PSTN, ADSL or ISDN"
194,Update All,"
Click the ‘No Selection’ drop down list next to the Update All button
Select the required Check code e.g. LNK
Tick the check box at the top – this will auto-tick all checkboxes against all faults on the screen
Click the Update All at the right of the banner
Actioned check-off codes can be changed by simply re-selecting a new code and clicking ‘Update’ e.g. if a pattern checked off as ‘NYV’ was subsequently found to be an outage, the code can be changed to ‘CVH’.
Once the exchange screen has been updated, the browser refresh button can be clicked to immediately update the totals in the Exchange list. Otherwise totals will update at the next 10-minute system refresh.
If a user has created a NODS from within Pattern Manager, the Check List will be automatically updated with CVH and the User ID of the consultant who created the NODS.
If a NODS has been auto-created by Priority Patterner, the Check List will be automatically updated with AVH – no user ID will be recorded.
Refer Table Check-off codes"
195,Multiple Update,"
Click the ‘No Selection’ drop down list next to the Update All button
Select the required Check code e.g. CVH
Tick the check boxes next to each of the faults to be checked off
Click the Update All at the right of the banner

"
196,Individual Update,"
Click the Chk_Lst Drop Down against the fault and select the required code e.g. NYV
Click the Update button in the centre of the banner

"
197,Check off Codes,"
When a fault pattern first displays in Pattern Manager, each fault in the pattern will display its SIIAM case status at the time the pattern was formed e.g. Field-Open or Test-Pending.
This status appears in a field called the Chk_Lst (Check List) which also contains a series of 3 character codes used by SOM to indicate the results of their analysis of the fault pattern e.g. ‘CVH’ when an outage has been confirmed or ‘NYV’ when an outage has not yet been confirmed.
The Check Code is used:
To indicate that a pattern has been analysed and actions
To alert users to new faults which have arrived within a pattern or which have formed new patterns
To display the respective volumes and percentages of checked vs unchecked faults in each exchange and region which is an indication of workload and potential risk
By the Blackhawk interface to display colour coded alerts on the Sauron Switch Patterner display in the GOC which helps alert SAO to potential Switch issues
The user Id of the staff member who last actioned a check-off code will be recorded in the User column.
Once a Check code has been selected the screen changes must be saved by use of the ‘Update’ button.
There are three methods of checking off fault patterns:"
198,Table Check Off Codes,"
The following table lists standard check off codes in use by SOM and their meanings:"
199,Patterner Refresh Rates and Timings,"
The following table provides an indication of the timeframes and frequency for system refresh of data in each of the Patterners.
Example: 
SOM Super User changes CAN Patterner Threshold at 9:27
Changes will take until 9:30-9:31 to be processed
New patterns according to changed thresholds will display at next System update 9:35
"
200,Functionality common to all Patterners,"
The following sections describe key functionality, common to all the patterners, in detail.
The order of the following sections follows the approximate order in which each function will be encountered in the Patterners from left to right."
